# Snake Evolution

The model contains four scripts:
  - Brain.py: contains the NN
  - Food.py: spawns food on world and draws on window
  - World.py: initialises the world of a given size 
  - Snake.py: holds all the snake mechanics such as growing, dying conditions and movement
 
The classes are connected through the game.py and simulation.py. game.py is the single player mode with UI etc, simulation is what trains the snake over the generations.
